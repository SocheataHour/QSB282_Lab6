## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1

## Some Important Literature

@hosseini_centroid_2024 most recent method to quantify relative virulence using the centroid, which is the mean of the area under the curve.

@ceballos_quantifying_2021 contains an important methods to quantify relative virulence in the single virus and single host interaction.

@hall_growth_2014 contains the method to quantify relative virulence based on the simple first differential equation.

## A Cool Equation

$V_R \equiv \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{(I_{SC_i}+I_{SC_{i+1}})(t_i - t_{i+1})}{2(t_n-t_1)}$

$CI_i \equiv 1 - \frac{\bar{x}_i\bar{y}_j}{\bar{x}_{ctrl}\bar{y}_{ctrl}}$
