            Phage replication can be studied using various approaches, including measuring the optical density ({OD}) of a bacterial culture in a liquid medium in the presence of phages. A few quantitative methods are available to measure and compare the efficiency of phages by using a single index based on the analysis of {OD} curves. However, these methods are not always applicable to non-canonical {OD} curves. Using the concept of center of area (centroid), we developed a metric called Centroid Index ({CI}), sensitive to the trend of the growth curves ({OD} distribution) including bacterial regrowth, which is not considered by the methods already available. We also provide a user-friendly software to facilitate the calculation of {CI}. This method offers an alternative and more precise way to determine phage efficiency by considering the {OD} variations over time, which may help in the selection of phages for biocontrol applications.},

	abstract = {A challenge in virology is quantifying relative virulence (V R) between two (or more) viruses that exhibit different replication dynamics in a given susceptible host. Host growth curve analysis is often used to mathematically characterize virus–host interactions and to quantify the magnitude of detriment to host due to viral infection. Quantifying V R using canonical parameters, like maximum specific growth rate (μ max), can fail to provide reliable information regarding virulence. Although area-under-the-curve ({AUC}) calculations are more robust, they are sensitive to limit selection. Using empirical data from Sulfolobus Spindle-shaped Virus ({SSV}) infections, we introduce a novel, simple metric that has proven to be more robust than existing methods for assessing V R. This metric (I {SC}) accurately aligns biological phenomena with quantified metrics to determine V R. It also addresses a gap in virology by permitting comparisons between different non-lytic virus infections or non-lytic versus lytic virus infections on a given host in single-virus/single-host infections.},
